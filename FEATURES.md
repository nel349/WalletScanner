## Implementation Notes

### Streak Detection Feature
The streak detection feature will identify patterns in transaction history, such as:
- Multiple high-value transfers within a short period
- Consistent staking behavior
- Regular token swaps or trading activity

This data will be highlighted in charts with special visual indicators, allowing users to "flex" their on-chain activity when sharing.

### Chart Sharing Implementation
Chart sharing will be implemented using:
- html2canvas for converting Chart.js visuals to images
- React Native Share API for social media integration
- Custom overlay with branding elements
- Option to include/exclude certain data for privacy
