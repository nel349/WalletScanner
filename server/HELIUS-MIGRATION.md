# Migrating from Raw Solana Data to Helius API

This document outlines the changes made to migrate from using raw Solana RPC data to the more comprehensive Helius API data in the Wallet Scanner application.

## Why Helius API?

The Helius API provides several advantages over raw Solana RPC endpoints:

1. **Human-readable transaction descriptions** - Transactions include a clear description of what happened
2. **Simplified transaction type identification** - Each transaction has a well-defined "type" field
3. **Structured native and token transfers** - Transfers are organized into dedicated arrays
4. **Complete account data with balance changes** - Every account involved includes exact balance changes
5. **Structured instruction data** - Program calls are clearly formatted
6. **Pre-processed and normalized format** - Ready to use without complex parsing logic

## Implementation Changes

The following files were added or modified:

1. **server/src/services/helius.ts**: A new service that handles all Helius API interactions
2. **server/src/types/index.ts**: Added new types for Helius API responses
3. **server/src/routes/wallet.ts**: Updated to use HeliusService instead of SolanaService
4. **server/package.json**: Added axios as a dependency

## API Key Handling

### Setting up Environment Variables

For security reasons, the Helius API key must be provided via environment variables. **Never hardcode API keys in your source code**.

1. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory
2. Add your Helius API key:
   ```
   HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_api_key_here
   ```
3. Optionally, configure the API URL:
   ```
   HELIUS_API_URL=https://api.helius.xyz
   ```

The application will throw a clear error message if the API key is not set.

## Changes to API Behavior

### Balance Retrieval

Rather than direct RPC calls to get account balances, we now extract balances from the transaction data provided by Helius. This may provide slightly different results than direct balance queries, but offers contextual information about recent activity.

### Transaction Parsing

Helius API responses include pre-parsed transaction data with human-readable descriptions, categorized transfers, and structured account data. This eliminates the need for complex parsing logic previously required.

### Transaction by Signature

The Helius API has different endpoints for fetching transactions, and we now query by signature when needed rather than using the Solana RPC's getParsedTransaction method.

## Sample Helius Response Structure

```json
{
  "description": "5Hr7wZg7oBpVhH5nngRqzr5W7ZFUfCsfEhbziZJak7fr transferred a total 0.000005845 SOL to multiple accounts.",
  "type": "TRANSFER",
  "source": "SYSTEM_PROGRAM",
  "fee": 5825,
  "feePayer": "5Hr7wZg7oBpVhH5nngRqzr5W7ZFUfCsfEhbziZJak7fr",
  "signature": "3HQWFqZZLEXKZTxYfUWyjwBRRaw92tQKJz79ETVHdAxEDCf34zeG9gBuQiAGP85mNwykvtbukqAnCduGEaRqdqko",
  "slot": 337879745,
  "timestamp": 1746403834,
  "tokenTransfers": [],
  "nativeTransfers": [
    {
      "fromUserAccount": "5Hr7wZg7oBpVhH5nngRqzr5W7ZFUfCsfEhbziZJak7fr",
      "toUserAccount": "FfwD1JWztbBhwz4ymn364xiMnyGB8V7BZxGkA5xo5bdf",
      "amount": 1
    },
    // Additional transfers...
  ],
  "accountData": [
    {
      "account": "5Hr7wZg7oBpVhH5nngRqzr5W7ZFUfCsfEhbziZJak7fr",
      "nativeBalanceChange": -5845,
      "tokenBalanceChanges": []
    },
    // Additional account data...
  ],
  "instructions": [
    // Instruction details...
  ]
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add dotenv loading in the main server file
2. Implement more sophisticated pagination using Helius-specific parameters
3. Add additional Helius-specific endpoints and features
4. Add caching to reduce API calls
